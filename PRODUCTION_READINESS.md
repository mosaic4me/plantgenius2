## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Priority 1 (BLOCKING PRODUCTION)
1. **Rotate all exposed API keys**
   - Plant.id: Get new key from dashboard
   - Supabase: Rotate in project settings
   - SMTP2GO: Generate new API key

2. **Implement server-side payment verification**
   - Create backend verification endpoint
   - Add Paystack webhook handler
   - Test payment flow thoroughly

3. **Increase test coverage to 80%+**
   - Write tests for contexts
   - Add integration tests
   - Test critical user flows

### Priority 2 (HIGH IMPORTANCE)
4. **Configure Supabase RLS policies**
5. **Set up error tracking (Sentry)**
6. **Complete production environment setup**

### Priority 3 (RECOMMENDED)
7. **Add E2E tests with Detox**
8. **Implement analytics**
9. **Create troubleshooting guide**

---

## üìÖ ESTIMATED TIMELINE TO PRODUCTION

**Minimum**: 3-5 days (if focusing on critical items only)
**Recommended**: 1-2 weeks (for comprehensive production readiness)

### Day-by-Day Breakdown
**Day 1-2**: Critical security (API rotation, payment verification)
**Day 3-4**: Testing coverage improvement
**Day 5**: Final validation and deployment prep

---

## ‚úÖ VALIDATION COMMANDS

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:coverage

# TypeScript type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Linting
npm run lint

# Build for production
eas build --platform all --profile production

# Test environment variables
npm run start -- --clear
```

## üÜò SUPPORT

For questions or issues:
- **Technical Lead**: Review SECURITY.md and PAYMENT_INTEGRATION.md
- **Payment Issues**: See PAYMENT_INTEGRATION.md
- **Deployment**: See README.md

---

**Remember**: This checklist should be updated as tasks are completed. Never deploy to production with critical security items unchecked.
