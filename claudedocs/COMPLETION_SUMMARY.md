## 🎯 CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED BEFORE PRODUCTION

### 🚨 BLOCKING ISSUES (MUST FIX)

1. **Rotate All Exposed API Keys**
   - Plant.id API key: `grGApORUfuHYbsoLTWjZZ06cf1qXDxNzkCwCD7VjKgNt00IILE`
   - Supabase credentials
   - SMTP2GO API key
   - **Action**: Follow SECURITY.md rotation procedure

2. **Implement Server-Side Payment Verification**
   - Current client-side verification is INSECURE
   - **Action**: See PAYMENT_INTEGRATION.md for implementation guide

3. **Increase Test Coverage to 80%+**
   - Current: ~30%
   - **Action**: Write more tests for contexts, components, and integration flows

### ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

4. **Configure Supabase Row Level Security**
5. **Set up Sentry for error tracking**
6. **Install testing dependencies**:
   ```bash
